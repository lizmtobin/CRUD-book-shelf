# Book-Shelf - Track Your Reading


# What's this repo about?

This is a practice Sping Boot API with full CRUD functioanlity. It's a simple reading-list tracker, in which you can add, update and remove books from a list. I built it as part of a Java bootcamp with QA.

# What went in to the planning?

I preliminaarily draw up a workflow in Jira to segment key portions of the development into features I could branch in git. Through this project I have also learnt more about testing, in particular JUnit and Mockito. In future I would like to achieve greater test coverage, create a ERD diagram and build a relational database.


# Improvements 

If I had more time I would like to bootstrap the frontend for simple graphical usability and build multiple related entities, such as authors, so you could perform more complex queries.
